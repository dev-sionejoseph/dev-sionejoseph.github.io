### Problem Statement:

As a creative, I am acutely aware of how hard it can be to get your work in front of the audience that will appreciate it. With inconsistent forums such as art markets, fairs, and other gig work, artists tend to have a hard time making a consistent living. This web application aims to be a central hub for artists looking to reach a wider market, and patrons of the arts looking to consume new creative works.

### Target End User:

-Artists who are tired of the overhead of other arts/craft e-commerce sites.

-Art lovers looking to acquire new pieces from artists who may get lost in the noise on other platforms.
